        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of the term, I'd like to have a handle on the basics of HTML. Even before that, perhaps, I'd like to gain a better understanding of the applications of coding in general. It feels very elusive in my mind right now, and it feels difficult jumping right into it right now. I’m feeling like I need a super-simplified breakdown- which is why I’m finding the readings to be super helpful supplementation. The two apps we’re currently using, Visual Studio Code and GitHub still confuse me a bit. I’m not clear on their purposes and uses. This being said, a review of possible tech would be helpful! For instance, do most people use VSC and Github? Are these specifically beginner-friendly, or more industry standard? In conclusion, (as a super-beginner) I feel I’m going to have to really get to the basics before I can recognize special tech or projects I’d like to cover. One thing did catch my eye in class the other day, though- scrolling-activated animations. I love it when websites have these, so I’m excited to get to learn this specific skill. I love the website for Glossier- a trendy makeup company. It's understated and restricted in it's use of many different colors, using a light pink as the main accent which creates a cute, feminine touch. The large images of their beautifully packaged products make me want to click, and ultimately, buy.  </p>
