        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of the term, I'd like to have a handle on the basics of HTML. Even before that, perhaps, I'd like to gain a better understanding of the applications of coding in general. It feels very elusive in my mind right now, and it feels difficult jumping right into it right now. I’m feeling like I need a super-simplified breakdown- which is why I’m finding the readings to be super helpful supplementation. The two apps we’re currently using, Visual Studio Code and GitHub still confuse me a bit. I’m not clear on their purposes and uses. This being said, a review of possible tech would be helpful! For instance, do most people use VSC and Github? Are these specifically beginner-friendly, or more industry standard? In conclusion, (as a super-beginner) I feel I’m going to have to really get to the basics before I can recognize special tech or projects I’d like to cover. One thing did catch my eye in class the other day, though- scrolling-activated animations. I love it when websites have these, so I’m excited to get to learn this specific skill. I love the website for Glossier- a trendy makeup company. It's understated and restricted in it's use of many different colors, using a light pink as the main accent which creates a cute, feminine touch. The large images of their beautifully packaged products make me want to click, and ultimately, buy.  </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1, I’m planning on doing a personal food log. Each of the 5 content pages will represent 1 day, where I will feature pictures and descriptions of each food item I consumed that day. I want to photoshop each image so that only the food itself is showing, like a cut out mask on a colored background. I hope to involve some interaction within the photo content- for instance: when you roll over an image of a food item, I want to show it gone/eaten/unwrapped. I’m thinking of featuring a “spotlighted meal of the day” on each subpage.  I thought collecting my own content would be a good way to ensure a cohesive design. Each page will be unique in its visual content because the images themselves will be different, allowing for the introduction of new shapes, forms, and colors on each page. Though I plan on maintaining a color scheme, of course, each page may involve a slightly different layout/placement of color blocking. Hopefully the variety of images will create uniqueness to the pages. I will likely be sampling colors from my images for the colors used in the design. I’m also considering choosing just 2 or 3 colors- maybe a warm colored palette- and using them throughout the site. My typography will complement my subject matter by reinforcing the “journal” aspect of my concept. I plan to have some of the text and images overlap. Besides that, I’m still unsure about my typographical choices- I’ll explore this more in my design comps. </p> 
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: Apple. The scrolling activated animations are awesome.  <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-12/"></a></p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: Perhaps a fellow vegetarian or college student would love to use my website. I think it could be compelling to other people who don’t want to eat meat but also aren’t super health freaks. Very specific hobbies of this person might include carrying more groceries back from the store than they can comfortably hold, but forgetting some kind of necessity they were supposed to pick up, listening to the same songs over and over again, and fighting the urge to put stickers on everything. </p>
